                    <p>
                        <strong>The World Wide Web </strong> (WWW) is a system that allows users to share content over
                        the Internet. It
                        was
                        invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he worked at CERN. His aim was to create a system that
                        allowed scientists around the world to share information automatically and efficiently. The Web
                        combined the emerging technologies of computers, data networks, and hypertext into a single,
                        user-friendly global information system.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Berners-Lee wrote his first proposal for the Web in March 1989 and a second in May 1990.
                        Together
                        with Belgian engineer Robert Cailliau, he refined the concept into a formal management proposal
                        later
                        that year. That document introduced key ideas such as “hypertext documents” accessible through
                        “browsers.” By the end of 1990 Berners-Lee had developed both the first web browser and web
                        server,
                        running on a NeXT computer at CERN. To prevent it from being accidentally switched off, the
                        computer
                        had a hand-written note in red pen: <em>“This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!”</em>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The world’s first website, hosted at <a href="http://info.cern.ch">info.cern.ch</a>, served as
                        an introduction to the
                        project.
                        It provided details on hypertext, technical instructions for setting up a web server, and links
                        to
                        emerging websites. The creation of Tim Berners-Lee marked the beginning of the WWW as the most
                        popular
                        method for sharing knowledge.

                    <p>
                        Whenever you click a link or enter a web address, your browser goes through several steps before
                        displaying
                        the page. This process involves key web technologies that work together, including URIs, HTTP,
                        and
                        web
                        browsers. These systems were initially described by Tim Berners-Lee and are outlined in the
                        World
                        Wide
                        Web Consortium’s <a href="bibliography.html#w3c-2004">(W3C, 2004)</a> <em>Architecture of the
                            World Wide Web</em>.
                    </p>

                <section id="web-page-delivered">
                    <h2> How a Web page is delivered</h2>
                    <h3 id="identifying-resource">Identifying the Resource</h3>
                    <p>
                        Everything on the web starts with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The most commonly used
                        type
                        of
                        URI
                        is a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The W3C explains that “items of interest, referred to as
                        resources,
                        are identified by global identifiers called Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)” <a
                            href="bibliography.html#w3c-2004">(W3C, 2004)</a>. For
                        example,
                        when you type a URL like <code>https://example.com</code>, your browser knows which resource to
                        request
                        and where to find it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the URI is identified, the browser translates the domain name (like
                        <code>example.com</code>)
                        into
                        an IP
                        address using the Domain Name System (DNS). Then it establishes a TCP connection with the web
                        server,
                        creating a direct path for sending and receiving data.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="requesting-page">Requesting the Page</h3>
                    <p>
                        After the connection is made, the browser sends a request using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer
                        Protocol).
                        As CERN explained early on: <em>“The WWW project defines its own protocol for information
                            transfer,
                            called
                            HTTP… The HTTP client sends a document identifier, and the server responds with hypertext or
                            plain
                            text”</em>
                        <a href="bibliography.html#cern-1992">(CERN, 1992)</a>. The most common request is an HTTP <code>GET</code>, which asks the server to send
                        back
                        the
                        contents of the page.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="receiving-display">Receiving and Displaying the Content</h3>
                    <p>
                        The server responds with the requested file, usually written in HTML. Along with the main
                        content,
                        it
                        provides additional information called metadata, which helps the browser understand how to
                        process
                        the
                        file.
                        The W3C describes each response as a <em>“representation”</em> — a version of the resource at a
                        specific
                        time <a href="bibliography.html#w3c-2004">(W3C, 2004)</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When the browser receives this data, it reads the HTML and looks for other linked resources,
                        such as
                        images,
                        CSS, or JavaScript. Those resources are requested as needed and help the browser render the
                        final
                        page.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="why-it-works">Why It Works So Well</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tim Berners-Lee (1996) noted that the web was designed as “a common information space in which
                        we
                        communicate
                        by sharing information.” Its success stems from simple, open standards — URIs for naming, HTTP
                        for
                        communication,
                        and HTML for structure — which allow computers worldwide to interoperate.

                <section id="how-pages-work">
                    <h2>Briefly how web pages work</h2>

                    <p>
                        When a browser loads a webpage, it starts by downloading the HTML and turning it into a
                        structure
                        called
                        the
                        <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>. At the same time, it fetches other resources the
                        page
                        needs — like
                        CSS files, which control how the page looks. Once those CSS files are downloaded the browser
                        processes
                        them and
                        builds the <strong>CSS Object Model (CSSOM)</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When both the DOM and CSSOM are ready, the browser combines them to form the <strong>render
                            tree</strong>, which
                        contains only the elements that will actually appear on the screen (so anything hidden with CSS,
                        e.g.
                        <code>display: none</code>, is skipped).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next comes the layout stage — also known as <em>reflow</em> — where the browser computes the
                        size
                        and
                        position
                        of each element based on the screen or window size. After layout it moves to <em>painting</em>,
                        where it
                        draws:
                        text, images, backgrounds, borders, and shadows. For complex pages or animations the browser may
                        separate content
                        into different layers so it can update parts of the page more efficiently.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because the browser needs the CSSOM and the render tree before it can display styled content,
                        external
                        CSS files can
                        block rendering. This means the page may not fully appear until styles are downloaded and
                        processed.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Process (simple)</h3>
                    <p>In simple terms, the process looks like this:</p>
                    <pre>
Load HTML → Build DOM → Load CSS → Build CSSOM → Combine into Render Tree → Layout → Paint &amp; Composite
      </pre>

                    <p>
                        Understanding these steps helps developers build faster, smoother websites and improves the user
                        experience.
